MySql:

You can manipulate the database with the mysql command line interface from within your vagrant terminal session:

mysql --user=root --port=3306  edxapp
If you want to use a GUI tool from your host system, that is also possible. E.g. for MySQL Workbench, you would set up a new Server connection with these settings:

Connection Method: Standard TCP/IP over SSH
SSH Hostname: 192.168.33.10:22
SSH Username: vagrant (the password is 'vagrant')
MySQL Hostname: 127.0.0.1
MySQL Server Port: 3306
Username: root (no password)
Default Schema: edxapp
Note: You may also need to specify the SSH Key File, which should be located at "~/.vagrant.d/insecure_private_key"


mongoDB:

Address: 192.168.33.10
Port: 27017
